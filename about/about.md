# About Me
My career began at the intersection of technology and public service.
After graduating from Penn State with a B.S. in Economics in 2021, I immediately impacted the national healthcare landscape during a critical period.
Joining the U.S. Department of Health \& Human Services (HHS) as a Data \& Analytics Intern, I quickly advanced to an IT Specialist Data Consultant.

During my tenure at HHS (2021-2023), I played a pivotal role in the Federal COVID-19 response.
I engineered high-throughput data pipelines and deployed machine learning models within Palantir Foundry to monitor national hospital data integrity.
My leadership abilities emerged early. I managed public-facing platforms like Healthdata.gov and led a technical team of 11 interns, among my many other responsibilities. I was the guy that my supervisors would turn to when they needed someone to figure out how to fix whatever issue our pipelines were having. My contributions were recognized with an Employee of the Quarter Award from the HHS OCIO. Driven to deepen my technical expertise, I pursued a Master of Statistics at North Carolina State University (2023).
This academic pivot marked a transition from operational data science to rigorous statistical research.

## What I'm Working on Currently
Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in Biostatistics at the University of Minnesota (expected graduation 2028) and I was an NIH National Research Service Award Fellow (T32) for 2 years. My research now operates at the cutting edge of psychopathology and biostatistics.
I develop novel Bayesian machine learning methods to analyze high-dimensional neuroimaging (MRI) data, specifically looking for outlier trajectories in pediatric brain development related to psychopathology.
